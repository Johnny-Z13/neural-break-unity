# Project Design Document Template
<!--
Instructions for your team:
- Fill in sections relevant to your project (delete sections that don't apply)
- Be specific - Claude works best with concrete details, not vague descriptions
- Include constraints and non-goals to prevent scope creep
- Add reference links, images, or examples where helpful
- Questions in [brackets] are prompts to help you think - replace with your answers
-->

## Implementation constraints (for AI execution)

- Follow the structure and intent of this document exactly.
- Do not add systems, features, or abstractions not explicitly described.
- Prefer simple, readable implementations over extensibility.
- Avoid magic numbers — expose tunables as named constants.
- If information is missing, leave TODOs rather than guessing.
- Match existing project patterns where referenced.

<!--
TIPS FOR WORKING WITH CLAUDE:

1. Be specific over vague
   Bad: "Combat should feel good"
   Good: "Combat should feel punchy - 0.1s hitstop, screen shake on impact, enemies flash white and knockback 2 units"

2. Include constraints
   Claude can spiral into over-engineering. Tell it what NOT to do.

3. Reference existing code
   "Follow the pattern in PlayerController.cs" is more useful than describing the pattern.

4. Quantify when possible
   Numbers, ranges, and ratios are clearer than adjectives.

5. State your priorities
   "Polish is more important than features" or "Ship fast, iterate later"

6. Include examples
   Screenshots, code snippets, or links to similar features help enormously.
